# Extended Kalman Filter Project 
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

This was the fifth project in Udacity's Self Driving Car NanoDegree. The task was to create a kalman filter to track laser and extended kalman filter to track radar measurements of a simulted vehicle using C++. In the src files "tools.cpp", "FusionEKF.cpp", and "kalman_filter.cpp", you will find my code.
